# Gitted Carthistoire web-app

Carthistoire is a web app I wrote in 2010 for the *Concours IGN*, a
contest organized by the French national mapping agency for authoring
mobile and web applications that use their API services.

## The Gitted wrapping-up

This repository can auto-generate an LXC container fully configured
with CartHistoire installed.

## Status

The Software, actually, does not work as the API service provided by
IGN has been shut down and/or the API access token key could not be
renew.

What to do next?
* Adapt the code to use OpenStreetMap as the base map instead of IGN
* Adapt the recorded coordinate from Lambert93 to WGS 84
